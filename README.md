1. First I make one react app using create-react-app.
2. Make one card component.
inside card component I have one main div. I part the div in two part. one for color and another for text. And give border box. 
3. Then I render the Card component inside App component. 
And pass the value (color and text) as props.
4. Then I recive props inside Card component. 
5. Finally upload the code in github and hosted it on vercel.
